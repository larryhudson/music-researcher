# A music researcher tool

So this is a tool that will help music fans explore music, track a queue of music they want to check out, and find connections.

## Ideas

- listen to song previews using Spotify
- search the web for reviews, articles, and save articles for reading
- explore record labels using Discogs data
- search wikipedia for data about band, album, etc?
- for a review, use AI to extract mentioned artists?

## Basic plan

To get this going:
1. Plan the database structure.
2. Plan the frontend and backend functions.
3. Start building.

## Database structure

- spotifyArtistId
- name
- discogsArtistId

Album

- discogsAlbumId?
